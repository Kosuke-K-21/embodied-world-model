6. **Smelt Iron**: Craft a furnace using cobblestone. Smelt the iron ore into iron ingots using wood or coal as fuel.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot0**: Share tasks and resources with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the process and ensure efficient resource management.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Wood**: Start by punching trees to collect wood logs. Convert these logs into wooden planks and then into sticks.
2. **Craft Wooden Tools**: Use the wooden planks and sticks to craft a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe.
3. **Mine Stone**: Use the wooden pickaxe to mine cobblestone from nearby stone blocks.
4. **Craft Stone Tools**: With the cobblestone, craft a stone pickaxe and other stone tools if needed.
5. **Find Iron Ore**: Search for iron ore, which is typically found underground. Mine it using the stone pickaxe.
6. **Smelt Iron Ore**: Collect some coal or use wood to smelt the iron ore in a furnace, turning it into iron ingots.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with Friend**: Since the mode is cooperative, coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to divide tasks, such as one player gathering resources while the other crafts tools, to speed up the process.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Wood**: Start by punching trees to collect wood logs. Convert these logs into wooden planks and then into sticks.
2. **Craft Wooden Tools**: Use the wooden planks and sticks to craft a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe.
3. **Mine Stone**: Use the wooden pickaxe to mine cobblestone from nearby stone blocks.
4. **Craft Stone Tools**: With the cobblestone, craft a stone pickaxe and other stone tools if needed.
5. **Find Iron Ore**: Search for iron ore, which is typically found underground. Mine it using the stone pickaxe.
6. **Smelt Iron Ore**: Collect some coal or use wood to smelt the iron ore in a furnace, turning it into iron ingots.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with Friend**: Since the mode is cooperative, coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to divide tasks, such as one player gathering resources while the other crafts tools, to speed up the process.

----------------retrieved info ----------------------
long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Wood**: Punch trees to collect wood logs. Convert logs into planks and then into sticks. This will be the foundation for crafting tools.
2. **Craft Wooden Tools**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden pickaxe. This will allow you to mine stone.
3. **Mine Stone**: Find a nearby stone deposit and mine enough cobblestone to craft a stone pickaxe.
4. **Craft Stone Tools**: Upgrade to a stone pickaxe using the cobblestone and sticks.
5. **Find Iron Ore**: Locate and mine iron ore using the stone pickaxe. You will need at least three iron ores.
6. **Smelt Iron**: Craft a furnace using cobblestone. Smelt the iron ore into iron ingots using wood or coal as fuel.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot0**: Share tasks and resources with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the process and ensure efficient resource management.

2. **Craft Wooden Tools**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden pickaxe. This will allow you to mine stone.
3. **Mine Stone**: Find a nearby stone deposit and mine enough cobblestone to craft a stone pickaxe.
4. **Craft Stone Tools**: Upgrade to a stone pickaxe using the cobblestone and sticks.
5. **Find Iron Ore**: Locate and mine iron ore using the stone pickaxe. You will need at least three iron ores.
6. **Smelt Iron**: Craft a furnace using cobblestone. Smelt the iron ore into iron ingots using wood or coal as fuel.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot0**: Share tasks and resources with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the process and ensure efficient resource management.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Wood**: Punch trees to collect wood logs. Convert logs into planks and then into sticks. This will be the foundation for crafting tools.
2. **Craft Wooden Tools**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden pickaxe. This will allow you to mine stone.
3. **Mine Stone**: Find a nearby stone deposit and mine enough cobblestone to craft a stone pickaxe.
4. **Craft Stone Tools**: Upgrade to a stone pickaxe using the cobblestone and sticks.
5. **Find Iron Ore**: Locate and mine iron ore using the stone pickaxe. You will need at least three iron ores.
6. **Smelt Iron**: Craft a furnace using cobblestone. Smelt the iron ore into iron ingots using wood or coal as fuel.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot0**: Share tasks and resources with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the process and ensure efficient resource management.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Wood**: Start by punching trees to collect wood logs. Convert these logs into wooden planks and then into sticks.
2. **Craft Wooden Tools**: Use the wooden planks and sticks to craft a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe.
3. **Mine Stone**: Use the wooden pickaxe to mine cobblestone from nearby stone blocks.
4. **Craft Stone Tools**: With the cobblestone, craft a stone pickaxe and other stone tools if needed.
5. **Find Iron Ore**: Search for iron ore, which is typically found underground. Mine it using the stone pickaxe.
6. **Smelt Iron Ore**: Collect some coal or use wood to smelt the iron ore in a furnace, turning it into iron ingots.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with Friend**: Since the mode is cooperative, coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to divide tasks, such as one player gathering resources while the other crafts tools, to speed up the process.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Wood**: Punch trees to collect wood logs. Convert logs into planks and then into sticks. This will be the foundation for crafting tools.
2. **Craft Wooden Tools**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden pickaxe. This will allow you to mine stone.
3. **Mine Stone**: Find a nearby stone deposit and mine enough cobblestone to craft a stone pickaxe.
4. **Craft Stone Tools**: Upgrade to a stone pickaxe using the cobblestone and sticks.
5. **Find Iron Ore**: Locate and mine iron ore using the stone pickaxe. You will need at least three iron ores.
6. **Smelt Iron**: Craft a furnace using cobblestone. Smelt the iron ore into iron ingots using wood or coal as fuel.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot0**: Share tasks and resources with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the process and ensure efficient resource management.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Wood**: Start by punching trees to collect wood logs. Convert these logs into wooden planks and then into sticks.
2. **Craft Wooden Tools**: Use the wooden planks and sticks to craft a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe.
3. **Mine Stone**: Use the wooden pickaxe to mine cobblestone from nearby stone blocks.
4. **Craft Stone Tools**: With the cobblestone, craft a stone pickaxe and other stone tools if needed.
5. **Find Iron Ore**: Search for iron ore, which is typically found underground. Mine it using the stone pickaxe.
6. **Smelt Iron Ore**: Collect some coal or use wood to smelt the iron ore in a furnace, turning it into iron ingots.
7. **Craft Iron Pickaxe**: Use the iron ingots and sticks to craft an iron pickaxe.
8. **Coordinate with Friend**: Since the mode is cooperative, coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to divide tasks, such as one player gathering resources while the other crafts tools, to speed up the process.
